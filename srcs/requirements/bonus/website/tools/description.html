                    WordPress (WP, or WordPress.org) is a web content management system. It was 
                    originally created as a tool to publish blogs but has evolved to support publishing other 
                    web content, including more traditional websites, mailing lists, Internet forums, 
                    media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems, and online stores. 
                    Available as free and open-source software, WordPress is among the most popular 
                    content management systems – it was used by 22.52% of the top one million websites as of 
                    December 2024.

                    The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of 
                    computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server 
                    model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
                    FTP users may authenticate themselves with a plain-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form 
                    of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. 
                    For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, 
                    FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
